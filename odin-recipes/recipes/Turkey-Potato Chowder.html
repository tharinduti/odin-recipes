        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>Combine potatoes, mixed vegetables, onions, celery, parsley and chicken broth in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in turkey and poultry seasoning.        </ol>
        <ol>Whisk half-and-half and flour together in a small bowl until smooth; stir mixture slowly into the hot soup. Continue to stir until soup thickens slightly and reaches a chowder-like consistency, about 5 minutes. Stir in Sriracha, salt, and pepper.</ol>
        <ol>Ladle into soup bowls and garnish with crumbled bacon.</ol>
